## üõ†Ô∏è **Changes**

This repository has been modified to suit our course project, which investigates the impact of client dropout in Vertical Federated Learning.  
Key changes include:

1. **Removed Features**:
   - Differential Privacy (DP) implementation.
   - Contribution calculation logic.

2. **Added Features**:
   - Logic for handling **active clients**.
   - A toggleable variable named `active_clients` to specify which clients are currently participating in the training process.
