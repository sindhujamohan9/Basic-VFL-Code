# Vertical Federated Learning with Client Dropout

This repository is a modified version of the original implementation of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) by Kang Wei et al. We intend to use this code for our course project that investigates drop out clients in VFL.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Changes**

This repository has been modified to suit our course project, which investigates the impact of client dropout in Vertical Federated Learning.  
Key changes include:

1. **Removed Features**:
   - Differential Privacy (DP) implementation.
   - Contribution calculation logic.

2. **Added Features**:
   - Logic for handling **active clients**.
   - A toggleable variable named `active_clients` to specify which clients are currently participating in the training process.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have `pipenv` installed to manage the Python environment.
```
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
Python torch_vertical_FL_train_dropout_clients.py
```
You dont have to run the code using the args listed in the code. You can run the code directly using the above command.
